# 1 - Problem

## Study the three level atom (in different configurations)

Evaluate Hamiltonian and develop Master equation solutions.
Check interaction with External Field.
We must assume that the energy levels are separated to use the rotating wave approximation. (so we can see each level individually)
- Two level system can be solved with Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA)
